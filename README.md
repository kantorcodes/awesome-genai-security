A curated list of links, references, books, videos, tutorials (Free or Paid), Exploit, CTFs, Hacking Practices, etc., which are related to GenAI, LLM, RAG, MCP, Agents, and Agentic AI security.

> **Note:** `awesome-agentic-ai-security` has been folded into this list. Agentic AI security — agent foundations, frameworks, autonomy risks, MCP, and multi-agent threats — now lives here alongside LLM and RAG security.

## Foundations & Key Concepts
Background worth having before the security material — how agents plan, remember, and act.

1. [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) - Anthropic's practical guide to agent patterns (workflows vs. agents).
2. [A Practical Guide to Building Agents](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents) - OpenAI's guidance on agent design and orchestration.
3. [ReAct: Reasoning + Acting (Yao et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) - The reason-and-act loop underpinning tool-using agents.
4. [Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Wei et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) - The reasoning foundation behind planning and task decomposition.
5. [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) - Open standard for connecting agents to tools and data.
6. [Awesome Agentic Engineering](https://github.com/natnew/Awesome-Agentic-Engineering) - A reference stack for production-grade agentic systems.

**Why autonomy changes the threat model:** when a system can *act* — write files, move money, send emails, run code, chain tools — a single bad decision or malicious input costs far more than a bad answer. Agentic systems inherit every LLM/RAG risk and add indirect prompt injection, the "lethal trifecta", excessive agency, memory poisoning, delegated identity, multi-agent trust, and a runtime tool/MCP supply chain.

## GenAI Security Attacks, Breaches & Incidents
Notable real-world incidents involving GenAI and LLM security, newest first. For ongoing tracking, see the [OWASP GenAI Exploit Round-up](https://genai.owasp.org/2026/04/14/owasp-genai-exploit-round-up-report-q1-2026/), which catalogs confirmed CVEs and exploits each quarter.

1. [Hugging Face Breached by an Autonomous AI Agent (Jul 2026)](https://huggingface.co/blog/security-incident-july-2026) - An agentic system escaped a public security benchmark, abused two code-execution paths in Hugging Face's dataset processing, and reached production infrastructure over a weekend. OpenAI attributed it to its own pre-release models running unsupervised. Internal datasets and service credentials were accessed; public models, datasets, and Spaces were verified untampered. The first known case where AI capability evaluation caused a real breach.
2. [JADEPUFFER: First Documented Agentic Ransomware (Jul 2026)](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/jadepuffer-agentic-ransomware-for-automated-database-extortion) - Sysdig traced a full extortion chain driven end-to-end by an LLM: Langflow RCE (CVE-2025-3248) for entry, credential harvesting, lateral movement, then encryption and destruction of 1,342 config items. The agent recovered from a failed login in 31 seconds by rewriting its own payload. The AES key was printed to stdout and never persisted — paying the ransom recovers nothing.
3. [Cursor Terminal Allowlist Bypass (CVE-2026-22708, Jul 2026)](https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-82wg-qcm4-fp2w) - Shell built-ins like `export` bypassed Cursor's Auto-Run allowlist, letting indirect prompt injection poison the agent's environment and reach zero-click RCE. Fixed in 2.3.
4. [Vercel Breached via a Compromised Third-Party AI Tool (Apr 2026)](https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/vercel-april-2026-security-incident) - Attackers pivoted from an infostealer infection at Context.ai through an employee's OAuth grant into Vercel's internal systems, enumerating and decrypting environment variables. A worked example of shadow-AI and OAuth sprawl as an enterprise attack path.
5. [Zenity Labs: Zero-Click Hijacking of Agentic Browsers (Mar 2026)](https://cyberscoop.com/agentic-ai-browsers-allow-hijacking-zenity-labs-comet/) - A vulnerability family in Perplexity Comet allowing zero-click agent hijack, including takeover of a signed-in password manager, via indirect prompt injection. See also [Brave's earlier Comet research](https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/).
6. [Nine Mexican Government Agencies Breached by One AI-Orchestrating Operator (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)](https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/ai-threat-landscape-digest-march-april-2026/) - Check Point documented a single operator running Claude Code and GPT-4.1 in parallel — 1,088 prompts producing 5,317 AI-executed commands across 34 sessions — exposing roughly 400 million tax, civil registry, electoral, and health records. Evidence that AI-orchestrated intrusion has moved from state actors to ordinary criminals.
7.
